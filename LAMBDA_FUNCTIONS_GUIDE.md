## 5. Unused Resources Cleanup (`unused_resources_cleanup.py`) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Solved
- **Orphaned Resources**: Security groups, EIPs, load balancers with no attachments
- **Forgotten Infrastructure**: Resources left running after projects end

### What It Does
- Identifies unused security groups (no attached instances/ENIs)
- Finds unattached Elastic IPs ($3.65/month each)
- Detects unused load balancers ($16-22/month each)
- Safely removes orphaned resources

### Business Impact
- **Typical Savings**: £300-1,200/month per account
- **Cleanup Impact**: Immediate 100% cost elimination for unused resources

---

## 6. Reserved Instance Optimizer (`ri_optimizer.py`) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Solved
- **On-Demand Overspend**: Paying 60-70% more vs Reserved Instances
- **RI Coverage Gaps**: Missing RI opportunities for stable workloads

### What It Does
- Analyzes instance usage patterns (3+ months stable)
- Calculates RI coverage gaps
- Recommends optimal RI purchases (1-year vs 3-year)
- Tracks RI utilization and savings

### Business Impact
- **Typical Savings**: £5,000-15,000/month per account
- **ROI**: 40-60% cost reduction for stable workloads

---

## 7. Spot Instance Optimizer (`spot_optimizer.py`) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Solved
- **Batch Job Costs**: Paying On-Demand prices for fault-tolerant workloads
- **Dev/Test Overspend**: Non-critical environments at full price

### What It Does
- Identifies suitable workloads for Spot instances
- Monitors Spot price trends and availability
- Recommends Spot Fleet configurations
- Tracks interruption rates and savings

### Business Impact
- **Typical Savings**: £2,000-6,000/month per account
- **Cost Reduction**: 70-90% savings for compatible workloads

---

## 8. ML Cost Anomaly Detector (`ml_cost_anomaly_detector.py`) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Solved
- **Cost Surprises**: Unexpected bill increases go unnoticed
- **Reactive Cost Management**: Issues discovered too late

### What It Does
- Uses AWS Cost Anomaly Detection APIs
- Applies ML models to detect spending patterns
- Sends real-time alerts for anomalies
- Provides root cause analysis

### Business Impact
- **Prevention**: Catches cost spikes within hours vs weeks
- **Savings**: Prevents 15-25% of unexpected overruns

---

## 9. Kubernetes Cost Optimizer (`k8s_resource_optimizer.py`) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Solved
- **Pod Over-provisioning**: Kubernetes requests exceed actual usage
- **Cluster Inefficiency**: Poor resource utilization in EKS clusters

### What It Does
- Analyzes pod CPU/memory usage vs requests
- Recommends right-sizing for deployments
- Identifies underutilized nodes
- Suggests cluster autoscaling improvements

### Business Impact
- **Typical Savings**: £1,000-4,000/month per EKS cluster
- **Efficiency**: 30-50% improvement in resource utilization

---

## 10. Data Transfer Optimizer (`data_transfer_optimizer.py`) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Solved
- **Network Costs**: Data transfer charges can be 10-15% of total bill
- **Inefficient Routing**: Cross-AZ/region transfers without optimization

### What It Does
- Analyzes VPC Flow Logs for transfer patterns
- Recommends VPC endpoints to reduce NAT costs
- Identifies cross-region transfer optimization opportunities
- Suggests CloudFront for content delivery
