- **Governance Maturity**: <40% of resources properly tagged
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Reactive cost management in 75% of cases

### Platform Deployment & Customization
**Enterprise FinOps Platform Architecture**:

```python
# Multi-Tenant FinOps Platform (Deployed across 50+ client environments)
class EnterpriseFinOpsPlatform:
    def __init__(self, client_config):
        self.client_context = self.load_client_configuration(client_config)
        self.optimization_engines = self.initialize_optimization_modules()
        self.compliance_framework = self.setup_regulatory_compliance()
        
    def deploy_client_environment(self, client_id):
        """
        Automated deployment of customized FinOps platform
        Average deployment time: 72 hours
        """
        terraform_config = self.generate_client_terraform(client_id)
        lambda_functions = self.customize_optimization_logic(client_id)
        monitoring_stack = self.setup_client_monitoring(client_id)
        
        return self.orchestrate_deployment(
            terraform_config, lambda_functions, monitoring_stack
        )
